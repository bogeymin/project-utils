We find it useful to collect commonly used resources in a single place and since pyprojectutils is about project
utility, it seemed natural to locate these here.

Cookiecutter Templates
======================

You may find these `Cookiecutter`_ templates useful.

- `Ansible for Django`_: Add a deploy directory to your Django project.
- `Django App (Full)`_: A Django app with all of the trimmings.

Tools
=====

BBEdit (Desktop)
----------------

`BBEdit`_ is a nice (Mac only) text editor that fills the need for quick edits, or for editing files not specifically
supported by an IDE tool such as PyCharm (below).

PyCharm (Desktop)
-----------------

A lot of developers will give up their text editor after it is pried from their cold, dead fingers. We know that still
happily use as `Vim`_ or `Emacs`_. The problem is that programming is *not* simply text. The productivity boost from
code completion, function signatures, and quick cross-reference makes a strong case for using and IDE.

Many use a free tool such as `Eclipse`_. However, we've found that a tool built specifically for the language will
always be easier to configure and use, and is well worth the expense.

With this in mind, we whole-heartedly recommend `PyCharm`_ as the preferred tool for Python and Django development.

Virtual Env Wrapper (CLI)
-------------------------

`Virtual Env Wrapper`_ is a utility for managing Python virtual environments. While we prefer to use PyCharm's *Create
VirtualEnv* option, we still use the tools provided by Virtual Env Wrapper.

Waffle (Web)
------------

`Waffle`_ is a project management tool that integrates with GitHub issues. It is easy to use without being intrusive
for every day development work.
