A collection of documentation and command line utilities for managing a software project.

Status
======

This project is still under active development, but we're using it every day. It is reasonably stable if you want to
try it out, but things will be changing over time.

Theory
======

A great deal of project activity for a developer occurs on the local machine and often on the command line. The
utilities provided will ease some common activities and make difficult management tasks less difficult. The principle
theory behind this package is that a great deal of information may be gleaned from a project by establishing conventions
and (a little bit of) meta configuration.

With pyprojectutils you may:

- Initialize common project files.
- List, search, and filter your projects.
- Move inactive projects out of your way.
- Manage versions in a sensible and consistent manner across all projects.
- Manage dependencies and repos.
- Generate project documentation.
- Work with documentation and (coming soon) project assets.
